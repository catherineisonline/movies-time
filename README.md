# Movie Time

Welcome to the Movie Time project! This project was created as a way for me to showcase my skills as a Junior Web Developer. The project uses React to build a movie database application, styled with CSS, and utilizing the MovieDB API.

## Key Features
Fetch and display movie data from the [MovieDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/).
Render different outputs conditionally, depending on the availability of data.
Handle data when it's not available, to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Progress

I am not done with the project yet and it's not the final version!


## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are to:

Learn to manually create React without the CRA
Learn how to handle different types of data received from an API.
Practice working with React, CSS, and API's.
Enhance my skills in creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
